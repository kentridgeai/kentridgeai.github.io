title: Sliced Mutual Informaion

description: |
Generalization is the ability of a learning algorithm to perform well on unseen data. Explainability deals with providing clear and understandable reasons for the predictions of a learning algorithm. In this work, we explore generalization and explainability from an information theoretic perspective. We use a derivative of mutual information called sliced mutual information (SMI), which is scalable and efficient to compute. We show that SMI tracks generalization and memorization, and that an instance based version of SMI allows for explainability.
