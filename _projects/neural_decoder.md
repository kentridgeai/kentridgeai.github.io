This project aims to design neural network-based decoders for ultra-short linear and non-linear block codes. Our research delves into three types of neural decoders: single-label, multi-label, and concatenated coding-based decoders. Leveraging the power of deep learning models, our primary objectives are to achieve near maximum-likelihood (ML) performance in terms of both bit and block error rates, while simultaneously ensuring low decoding complexity. We strive to minimize latency and energy consumption by optimizing the number of hidden layers and hidden nodes within the neural decoders. To complement our experimental findings, we also provide theoretical analyses regarding the decoding complexity of each neural decoder.
