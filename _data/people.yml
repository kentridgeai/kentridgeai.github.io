    title: Ph.D. Student
    bio: "I graduated with a B.Sc (Hons) in Life Sciences and M.Sc from Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, from National University of Singapore, before working as a bioinformatician in National Cancer Center Singapore and Genome Institute of Singapore. Currently I am a PhD student enrolled in the NUS Graduate Schoolâ€™s Integrated Sciences and Engineering Programme (ISEP), and co-supervised by A/P Mehul Motani (machine learning PI) and Dr Iain Tan (clinical PI from NCCS/GIS).<br><br>
I am interested in applying machine and deep learning techniques to solve healthcare problems. My work touches on various topics pertinent to healthcare, such as the use of multi-view learning to integrate heterogeneous healthcare data, best practices to handle individual data modalities such as time-series, tabular data, and text data, explainability techniques to probe the black-box nature of deep learning models, and so on. Due to my background in cancer genomics, I am also interested in exploring ways to incorporate biological knowledge in the form of sequencing information to my models.<br><br>
In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano, listening to music, and playing with my kid. I also like to travel a lot."

    bio: "I received a B.Eng. degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2018. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the National University of Singapore, under the guidance of Prof. Mehul Motani.<br><br>

My research interests revolve around the intersection of communication engineering and machine learning. Specifically, I am engaged in exploring the deployment of deep learning models to tackle complex challenges in channel coding problems, information theory, and Semantic communication problems for future edge communication. By leveraging the power of machine learning techniques, and also utilizing the theoretical aspect of information theory, I seek to uncover innovative solutions that can enhance the efficiency and reliability of communication networks, also use the knowledge from communication theory to understand the black box of machine learning.<br><br>

In my free time, I enjoy playing piano, watching sci-fi movies and anime. I am also interested in photography."
